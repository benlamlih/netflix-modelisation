If we were to use microservices architecture we would have :
- Account Service
- Library Service (managing movies and tv shows depending on the region)
- Streaming Service (managing the video streaming part including pause, play..)
- Payment Service
- Recommendation Service (A lot of AI/ML Algorithms to suggest the best things
  to watch for a user so a separate service is needed just for this)
- Backoffice Service
