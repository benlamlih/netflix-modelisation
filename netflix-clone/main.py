# If we were to use microservices architecture we would have :
# - Account Service
# - Library Service (managing movies and tv shows depending on the region)
# - Streaming Service (managing the video streaming part including pause, play..)
# - Payment Service
# - Recommendation Service (A lot of AI/ML Algorithms to suggest the best things
#   to watch for a user so a separate service is needed just for this)
# - Backoffice Service
